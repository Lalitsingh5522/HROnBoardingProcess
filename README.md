Hi this is a basic level uipath project which anyone seeing this repo can implement easly and have learning as well
lets come to the point what this project is all about

so hers the problem

**problem** - when a new employee joins an orgnization the hr have to provide employee id and email to the new joinee but its a very repetative tidus process if count is very high.

**solution** - lets automate this process using uipath 

step 1 - we'll read employees data like name ,phone,email etc from excel
step 2 - iterate through excel rows and colums using for each row activity
step 3 - fill the data to the dummy website using type info activity
step 4 - use message box activity to read and show employee id and email to human user.
